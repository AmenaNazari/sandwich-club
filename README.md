# Sandwich Club

The Sandwich Club is a Java-based console application that simulates a sandwich shop ordering system. Users can build fully customizable sandwiches by choosing size, bread type, toppings, and extras like drinks and chips. It calculates prices in real-time and generates printable receipts for each order.

Purpose:
To give users a fun, interactive experience while practicing object-oriented design in Java.
Intended Users:
This app is built for anyone who wants to explore how sandwich orders are processed in a deli-style menu â€” students, hobby developers, or instructors assessing Java project design.

Briefly describe what this Java console application does. Mention its purpose and who the intended users are. Explain the main functionality and what problems it aims to solve.
